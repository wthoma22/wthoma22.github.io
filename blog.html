            <h2>Mod 1</h2>
          <p>My experience at Turing has been the most challenging, yet most
            rewarding and worthwhile experience I have ever undergone. The past
            six weeks of the program have taken an intense yet incredibly effective
            learning approach that has enabled myself to establish a solid foundation
            of knowledge in multiple areas of software engineering. These areas include
            but are not limited to, skills to write automated tests, pseudocoding, writing
            implementation code, and refactoring code to meet Ruby conventions. My favorite
            technical concept I have enjoyed learning is object-oriented programming. This is the
            core of Ruby programming, directing the programmer to focus on the content
            of each object and how that object itself behaves. So far, I have loved every
            second of my experience with Turing and greatly look forward to the experiences
            yet to come.</p>
